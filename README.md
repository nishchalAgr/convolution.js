# Convolution Visualizer

Simple image convolution visualizer. Written in JS and rendered using the Canvas API on HTML. Try it at:

## Purpose

Convolutions are essentially image filters defined by numerical matricies. They are one of the fundamental building blocks of Convolution Neural Networks.

## Other notes

 - Make sure element-wise sum of convolution is near 0 for best results
 - May add support for image uploading in the future
